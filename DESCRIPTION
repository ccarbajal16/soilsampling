Description: Provides methods for designing soil sampling schemes including
        spatial coverage sampling using k-means clustering, simple random
        sampling, stratified random sampling, and maxvol optimal design sampling.
        The maxvol method implements D-optimal experimental design based on maximum
        volume criterion for feature-based sample selection. Includes validation
        metrics to assess stratification quality through coverage efficiency
        (uniformity of cell distribution) and distance statistics. The package uses
        sf for spatial operations and does not require Java or the sp package.
        Spatial coverage sampling is based on Walvoort et al. (2010)
        <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2010.04.005>. Maxvol sampling is based on Petrovskaia
        et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114733>.
